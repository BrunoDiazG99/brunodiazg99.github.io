        <h2>-- Hi, I‚Äôm Bruno Diaz! Nice to meet you ü§ù </h2>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a Software Engineer (technically Informatics because that‚Äôs what
          my BSc says) based in Peru with experience in Web Development, looking
          to start my journey into the Game Development scene.
        </p>
        <p>I go by Haruchon online, hence the name of this website.</p>
        <p>
          This is just a page to show my current and past projects, my
          experiences and some extra info here and there.
        </p>
        <p>Hopeful to be able to get my dreams done and maybe more!</p>
        <p>
          By the way I really love MapleStory, Pokemon and League so if you find
          some references around this page, well now you know why.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to contact me, please do so by email!</p>
